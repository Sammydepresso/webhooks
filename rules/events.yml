    Hey #ping_reframing#, it's time for some Cognitive Reframing!

    If you have a negative thought, head over to #ch_reframing# and reframe it to be a more constructive thought! Using this process can help you break through the negative mental filters that we sometimes apply.

    All the people who participate will get 250 :cake:

    This event will last 12h. Remember to think positive!
