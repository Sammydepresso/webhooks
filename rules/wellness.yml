  - "#casual_reminder_intro# Everybody take a minute to drink a glass of water. That's all. And if you forgot to take your meds today, this is your reminder."
  - Your reminder to drink water! If you hate water, put some fruit in it or add a splash of juice or water flavorer.
  - Do you take vitamins or supplements for your health? Don't forget to take them today and keep your body healthy.
  - Get up and do a little exercise. Stretch, go for a 10-minute walk, do some jumping jacks - get your blood pumping. A little goes a long way. The server will still be here when you come back.
